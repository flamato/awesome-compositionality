### Architectural Bias

- David Ha, Andrew Dai, Quoc V. Le. [HyperNetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106), arXiv:1609.09106, ICLR, 2017 
  * The main idea is to use a hypernetwork to generate the weights for another network. An “embedding vector” is generated by a hyper RNN. This embedding vector is used to dynamically scale the weights of a RNN at every timestep. The approach is evaluated on different language tasks: character-level language modeling (PTB, Wiki), machine translation and handwriting prediction. The results outperform the baselines on these tasks marginally.
